# REFLECTION



Working on my portfolio using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and GitHub presented both technical and learning challenges. Initially, one of the biggest hurdles was understanding how Git and GitHub integrate with VS Code. I struggled with basic commands like cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing updates to GitHub. To overcome this, I spent time learning Git through tutorials and documentation, and I also made use of the built-in Git features in VS Code, such as the source control panel, which made the process more visual and intuitive.

Another challenge was dealing with merge conflicts when collaborating or switching between branches. At first, I found it confusing and stressful, but I learned to resolve conflicts manually by reviewing changes carefully and using the diff tools provided in VS Code. I also became more disciplined with writing clear commit messages and committing frequently, which helped track progress and avoid confusion.

If I were to improve the portfolio next, I would focus on enhancing the design and responsiveness. While the core functionality is in place, the visual layout could be more polished using CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. I would also consider adding continuous deployment using GitHub Actions or connecting the repo to a service like Netlify or Vercel, allowing for automatic updates whenever changes are pushed.

Overall, this project helped me grow more comfortable with essential development tools and improved my ability to troubleshoot and work independently.
